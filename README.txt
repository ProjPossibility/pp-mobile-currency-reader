Right now this is an experimental project as we investigate supporting development of our projects

Overview
The concept behind the mobile currency reader is a cellphone based application that will take a picture of a bill with a camera phone and detect its value automatically. During the SS12 competition a prototype was developed that does basic recognition for specific test cases using the Java Mobile Edition cellphone emulator.

Features
The mobile currency reader will accept an image as an input and attempt to match it against reference images. This is currently done from the command line.

Current Issues
The current implementation is very buggy, and needs work. It only correctly identifies in specific cases, and some cases can cause exceptions.

Future Plans
From the prototype developed at SS12, we want to develop a more robust identification algorithm and implement it on the Google Android platform.
