**_Right now this is an experimental project as we investigate supporting development of our projects_**

## Overview ##

The concept behind the mobile currency reader is a cellphone based application that will take a picture of a bill with a camera phone and detect its value automatically. During the SS12 competition a prototype was developed that does basic recognition for specific test cases using the Java Mobile Edition cellphone emulator.

## Features ##

The mobile currency reader will accept an image as an input and attempt to match it against reference images. This is currently done from the command line.

## Current Issues ##

The current implementation is very buggy, and needs work. It only correctly identifies in specific cases, and some cases can cause exceptions.

## Future Plans ##

From the prototype developed at SS12, we want to develop a more robust identification algorithm and implement it on the Google Android platform.
